This is where a font will be developed for the sitelen telo toki pona writing system

The writing system was first published onto the toki pona reddit by u/efofecks https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/jax1x2/sitelen_telo_v101_a_japaneseinspired_logographic/

As of right now, most of the characters have been completed but have not been compiled into a font file. I draw the characters using inkscape and the svg file can be found here.

All pu words and a few non pu words are done, and my plan is to keep adding non pu words as well as special characters. All critique is welcome, these characters have not been rendered into actual sentences and paragraphs yet so I have no idea how it would look. Probably not perfect.
