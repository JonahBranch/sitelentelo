This is where a font will be developed for the sitelen telo toki pona writing system

The writing system was first published onto the toki pona reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/jax1x2/sitelen_telo_v101_a_japaneseinspired_logographic/

As of right now, most of the characters have been completed but have not been compiled into a font file.

All pu words and a few non pu words are done, and my plan is to keep adding non pu words as well as special characters "!@#$%^&*(){}-=_+/\|<>,.?~`;:'
